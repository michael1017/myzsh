# myzsh

Just a script which setups my zsh environment.

## Usage

Via curl:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael1017/myzsh/master/install.sh)"
```

Via wget:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael1017/myzsh/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

**NOTE**: The provided one-click installation script will install myzsh to `~/.myzsh`. DO NOT remove this directory because the file `~/.zshrc` is just a symbolic link.
